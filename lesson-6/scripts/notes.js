// What are Booleans?
    // Booleans are another type of value;
        // Two values: True and False

// What is the purpose of Boolean values?
    // a Boolean value represents whether something is True or False.

// We do NOT surround booleans with quotes; because it is not a string.
    // to check for a boolean value, we can use 'typeof'. Ex. console.log(typeof true); output: boolean



// Comparison Operators:

    //  > Greater Than
    //  < Less Than
    //  >= Greater Than or Equal to
    //  <= Less Than or Equal to
    //  === Equal to (== and ===; the double equal tries to convert both values to the same type. the triple equal will look strictly for the same two values). Important: the same rules apply for != and !==.
    //  !== Not Equal to

// If-Statements
    // lets us write multiple groups of code
    // and then decide which code to run
