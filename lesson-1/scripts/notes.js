// What is JavaScript?
    // > we give instructions to the computer
    // > the computer follows our instructions

// Terminology:
    // > The instructions we give are called "code". When we press 'Enter' and the computer follows instructions, that is called 'running the code'.

// Syntax:
    // > rules that we have to follow when using a programming language.
    // > similar to English (grammar)
    // > difference is that in programming, we have to follow the rules of syntax or else the computer won't understand.
